# Simon Game

Advanced front-end development project for [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-simon-game)

## Requirements

1. Present user with a random series of button presses.
2. Each time user input a series of button presses correctly, user sees the same series of button presses but with an additional step.
3. Play a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.
4. Notify user of wrong button presses and then play the series of button presses again to remind the user of the pattern so he or she can try again.
5. Display number of steps in the current series of button presses.
6. Restart button that will return game to a single step.
7. Have a "strict mode" where if button press is wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
8. User can win game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. User is notified of win, then the game starts over.
